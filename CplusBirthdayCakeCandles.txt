Rather lovely if statement with counter installed. Taking 4 integers as input
finding the highest number and any equal companions, and outputting the number of 
recurrences of this 'Highest Value'.... it looks great and works really well.

int birthdayCakeCandles(vector<int> candles) {
    int n = candles.size();
    sort(candles.begin(), (candles.end()));
    int count = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
    if (candles[n-1]==candles[i]) 
        {
            count++;
        }
    }   
    return count; 
}
